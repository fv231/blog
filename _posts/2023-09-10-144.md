I've grown more anxious lately. I notice the difference. It's the worst in the morning, when I first wake up, but haven't gotten out of bed. I could feel my mind whirling and spinning around like a leather belt caught on a motor, lashing out to the nearest thing to worry about. Things like my job, family, money, relationships--you know, *everything*.

The more I worry, the more I draw in to worry. More things get caught in the spiral.

I couldn't tolerate it any more and have to get out of bed. That's become my bad alarm clock.
