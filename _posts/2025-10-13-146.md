I want to update my phone, laptop, and desktop now, everything. At first, I kept them because they still worked and nothing new attracted me. Then I kept them out of spite and I didn't want to give in to the cycle of disposable electronics. Then, I kept them just because they were old, and sentimentality burnished them with a glow. Now, I see clearly they are old crap I should have thrown away a long time ago.
