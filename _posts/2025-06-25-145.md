I got rid of the Atom and Github desktop apps. I feel cleaner. I never liked using Github, because I never liked using Git and version control in general. It's an endless source of random sudden errors that come out of nowhere. Like routers, wifi, networking, anything that you have to do arbitrary and inexplicable turn-it-off-and-on again methods to fix. Spongy as hell. I want all my problems to be fixed gear bike problems. The chain slipped off the gear. You see it. You put the chain back on. You can now ride the bike. The end. 

It comes back to a core thing I found after digging around inside myself for a while. Energy. That's it. It explains a lot of my behaviors and preferences and why I want to do some things and not others and in general explains me. It's biological too, so it's there on that base level. It's more basic than that, even, in a physics way, it's just entropy. Laziness. I can't resist entropy. I give in to rolling down the curve to a lower state and just want to stay there. Any upward movement out of the valley requires effort I don't want to spend.

For example. I like watching vlogs. It's easier than going out and doing the same things I see in the vlog. I don't want to lift a finger. I don't like to speak. Speaking uses more energy and cost to me than, often, what I gain in benefits from speaking. Speaking imposes a negative return, consistently, and I think on average, I'm deep in the negative. I crave good conversation. It's so, so rare.
