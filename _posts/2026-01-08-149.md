Things are more complicated, more uncertain. Complication isn't necessarily bad, but uncertainty is very, very bad. It's more definitionally bad, purer essence of bad, than bad. The way to goodness for me is to simplify and reduce, which is hard to square against how messy and expansive life naturally is. Does simplifying life mean less life? I can't imagine how living more, doing more, interacting with more people, can simplify and reduce. I'm sure I'm getting some kind of benefit from life to compensate for the uncertainty, and some kind of cost from simplifying, and there's a balance point somewhere in the middle. It's hard to see from here. I only feel beset.

I heard, life like jazz it doesn't resolve. That's true. It's why I don't like jazz.
