I haven't been writing, I haven't been thinking. I've stopped journaling after doing it daily for like nine years straight, that's crazy. My mind hasn't been still, and I haven't sat still, for a while now. I've always had introspection, or thought I did. Even that has become hard to come by. Shifted from automatic to manual. I'm losing things I didn't know I was holding. It makes me clutch.
