After a dry and sunny summer, it's finally chill, drizzly, and gray. It's only for a day or two, though. The storm is moving. It's raining now, and I hurried to record it, preciously, as if it had started snowing. I feel so much better in the rain. I need to find somewhere to live where the headlines aren't about a never-ending drought. I get thirsty every time and think about really dark yellow pee.
