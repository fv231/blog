The Night I Won the Lottery


I won the $344 million jackpot this week. _Holy shit_, right. It was the only ticket too. I hadn't figured out how much it would be after taxes and taking the lump sum, but the take-home had to be at least $100 million. _At least_. 

I found out Friday when I left work and checked my ticket like I always did. I felt like I had spent a week digging holes then filling them up again. I began buying lotto tickets a few days into the job.

I got back and collapsed on the couch, turned on the TV, and waited for the news to end. The little jingle came on before the drawing. Then, there they were. The beautiful numbers--_my_ beautiful numbers--up on the screen plain as day.

I sat up and stared at the TV, whole body paralyzed; I probably wasn't even breathing. Only my eyes moved, darting back and forth like crazy and checking the numbers on the ticket and the ones on the screen until it cut to commercial. I grabbed my phone and checked the numbers a dozen more times until I thought it best to lie down again. 

I had won. I was a millionaire. A hundred times over. 

I didn't run out into the streets in my robe and hug the mail lady or anything, right. I just kind of lay there, wide-eyed. I guess I was in shock.

But the thing was, the most intense euphoria flooded me then, wave after wave of it. It wasn't joy that I felt, not really, nothing so bright or trumpety like that. It was more like utter relief.

I wasn't poor or hurting for money, but I didn't realize just how pervasively money problems had gunked up on the surfaces of my life. In that moment, it felt like a million fizzing bubbles were rushing through my pores. So many of my worries and uncertainties and fears--they all cracked and sloughed away.

_I could lie here forever, just like this..._

I sat up. I had to tell somebody, right. But who? I saw everyone I knew lined up before me like troops for inspection. I tried to consider others, to be fair, but there really was only one choice.

I hesitated, then called Beth. 


*****


The place was Elbie's Diner, where we usually met. The food was terrible; people died from it. But it closed really late and they served breakfast all day, so what are you going to do, right. 

She was already there when I arrived, with a plate of fries. As I made my way to the booth, I mentally prepared myself on how to tell her. I would just go into it immediately, I decided, so there was no hiding period where I had to pretend things were normal. And I just couldn't wait any longer; I desperately needed some external, objective pinch to give me some grounding. I was ready. 

"Hey," she said, as I sat down.

"I won the lottery," I blurted out. 

"What?"

_What the hell, that didn't work at all!_ Before I could salvage things, the waitress had noticed me sit down and swayed right up with some big news of her own. 

"Good evening! I'm Loubelle, and let me first say, the shrimp special is amazing tonight, absolutely gorgeous. You have _got_ to try it. We make it into a patty and grill that with cheddar."

"So like a shrimp burger?" I said, making a face.

"No, sir, not a burger," Loubelle sniffed. "It's a melt."

"Right," I said. "I think I'll stick with the double cheeseburger--sorry double cheese melt."

"The shrimp sounds really good actually," Beth said and smiled at Loubelle. "I'll have that."

"You are fab, darling," Loubelle said, beaming at her. "Free refills for you." She glared at me, then took our menus and left.

"_Everyone_ gets free refills," I said, when Loubelle was out of earshot.

"Don't be mean," she said.

"I was fending off her hard sell!" I said. _That she probably had to say two dozen times tonight already. So she could buy her kids new shoes so they wouldn't get made fun of at school. Shit._

She eyed me for a second, then shrugged. She picked up a fry. "What were you saying before? You won something?"

"Uh," I said. 

_I could still back out. I didn't have to tell her._

"I--I won the lottery," I began, then powered through: "I found out today, just before I called you. One hundred million dollars, after taxes." I thought I had an idea of how she would react, but sitting here now, I realized I didn't know anything at all. 

She looked at me expectantly, as if waiting for the punchline. When I didn't say anything more, her eyes narrowed in suspicion, then widened. 

"Shut up," she finally said. She leaned in and scrutinized my face. I stared back. I had never really looked at her straight-on like this before, so close, for so long. I fought not to look away.

She blinked. "Shit, you're serious. I don't even know what to say. Congratulations? One hundred million...helllll." She drew that out for five seconds. "I mean, what are you going to do now?"

"Uh," I said.


*****


What would you do if you won one hundred million dollars? I knew exactly what I would do. I had a _spreadsheet_.

$100 million. First things first. I would go to the hospital and get tested for everything. I wanted to know whatever cancer might be lurking in my genes, what levels I needed my blood sugar to be, all STDs, parasites, everything. My life had just become exponentially more precious to me. I would put aside $5 million to self-insure against any medical surprises. This alone was the best possible use for the money.

$95 million. I would take $10 million in cash and split it among five banks across the country; $2 million each in regular savings accounts up to the federally insured limit, and the rest in safety deposit boxes. This was to ensure I never had to work again, even if I managed to lose everything else. I hoped I would never see this money.

$85 million left. I would buy $10 million in Treasury bonds, $10 million in bond funds, and $10 million in index funds. I would not touch the principle on these and just use the interest and dividends for income. If somehow all five banks failed, the stock market crashed, and the United States blew up, well, I guess I would have egg on my face then, right.

$55. I would spend $10 million to buy and renovate a small apartment building. Maybe four units, in a nice neighborhood with strollers and brunch places. I would hire an on-site property manager to deal with the property and tenants. I just wanted the rent checks every month. This would be my secondary source of income.

$45. Roughly half left. Bean counting over; time to spend! I would take $10 million to buy land and build a house. Nothing big or fancy. Much more importantly, it needed a view. On a hill, perhaps, or maybe along the coast. Then I would fill it with $10 million of shiny consumer materialism. Speakers, TVs, furniture, clothes, personal library, home theater, and on and on.

$25. Contract with an on-call service for hired help. A cook, a maid, a driver, and a gardener. Not sure how much everyone would cost. They wouldn't be living on the premises; they would just come when needed. Let's say $4 million for a few years. And, just because: a butler too! $1 million more.

$20. Time to travel. How much would I need? $1 million seemed more than enough. If I allocated $25,000 a trip, and go on ten trips a year, that would just be $250,000. I would set aside $5 million and see how long that lasted.

$15. Food and drinks. I would totally eat out every day. Even if I spent $1,000 a day for a year on restaurants and fancy groceries, I would not spend $1 million. Let me allocate $5 million to this category again, just for a round number.

$10. Cars, boats, bikes, ATVs? Why not. $5 million. 

$5 million dollars left. I was running out of things to buy and enthusiasm, even, to spend at this point. How did rich people keep this up? This last $5 million would hang around as a general expense account. If I wanted to buy a hundred pounds of Slim Jim's, hey, boom.

"Uh," I said again. I shrugged. "I don't know. I haven't really thought about it."

"What do you mean you haven't thought about it? Everyone has thought about it. I bet right this second there are at least three people in this diner fantasizing about what they would do if they won the lottery."

"Well, yeah, it has crossed my mind, of course. But it's the classic problem of choice paralysis. I can't decide or pick out specifics."

"You suck. Just pick something. Don't let it being the first choice make it special. It doesn't have to mean anything."

"Well," I said. "Okay, what would you do first? I'll take notes."

"Buy one million dollars' worth of gold coins and jewels," she said without hesitating. "Put it all in a heavy chest, like with serious iron bands and a giant lock. Then bury it somewhere. I'll draw up a vague map, rip it into several pieces, and hide them around the world. Put up the first piece online with clues to the others. People will go absolutely crazy."

I marveled. "That would make the most amazing show."

"_Treasure Hunt_," she nodded.

"Why isn't this a thing yet?" I said. 

"I know, right? Cameras could follow a bunch of people around as they try to figure out the clues and get to them first," she said.

"Some will play dirty and leave fake clues behind," I said.

"'I'm not here to make friends'," she did her best dramatic turn to the camera.

I laughed.

"So that's what I would totally do with $100 million freaking dollars. Oh boy." She slowly chewed on another fry. "Then, I would take the first flight out of this shithole town. Like, immediately, flip this table over and yell for a cab to the airport. Bora Bora, baby. Then Iceland. Then New Zealand. Then wherever, leaving treasure maps in my wake." She stared off dreamily.

Our food finally came. Loubelle sashayed her way through to our booth with our plates. Her shrimp burger looked unfortunately just like what you would expect a shrimp burger to look like. Where a beef patty would be, there were bits of shrimp instead, packed and formed with cheese holding everything together. She lifted and peered under the bun. She grimaced.

We ate for a while (she got more fries). I still wasn't sure how she was taking the news. She looked focused on her food at the moment. But before I could say anything, she stopped chewing and looked up.

"Hey, you lucky bastard," she said, pointing her fork at me. "It's all over now, you know, your life. This is low-grade reincarnation. You can do whatever, go anywhere, become whoever you want, clean slate--This is the last time I'll see you, isn't it? You came out to tell me you're leaving right now to some castle in France filled with supermodels."     

"What? No, I'm not going anywhere, it's not like that at all," I said, trying to reassure her. "You know me, I don't want to get a _castle_."

She paused. "Yeah," she said, not looking reassured at all, "I do know you." She glanced away to the side and--it happened between one blink and the next, but I didn't miss it--her face fell in what could only be described as resignation.

She turned back the next instant, and wielded her fork again. "Goddamn it, it's impossible not to be jealous. I want money!" She picked up the shrimp and actually bit off a chunk. With her mouth full, she said "So have you thought of what you would do yet?"

"Uh," I said.

"You have got to be the worst multi-millionaire ever," she said, still trying to chew.

_Say something quick. Don't be boring._ I racked my brain. Then I remembered. "I did think about going away."

"Great! Where to?"

"It's...well, it's not really to a particular place. When I first checked the numbers, when it hit me that I had won the lottery...so, okay, it was more of a reflex than anything."

"Reflex? What do you mean?" 

"It wasn't something _conscious_ on my part. At that moment, this really intense urge came to me, an urge to...disappear."

She furrowed her brow.

_Don't lose her._ I spoke in a rush. "I was lying there, very still, with the ticket in my hand, and I thought, what if I just disappeared? The thought, the urge, hit me out of nowhere, you know? I don't know where it came from. I remember thinking, I could get up right now, walk out the door, and never look back. Leave my job, my things, everyone--all of it. And I could keep doing that again and again in the future if I don't like where I end up. I could buy a lot of redos with $100 million." And then--whether from momentum or some desperation to say what I really mean, to feel _honest_--I said, "I could pretend to be a deaf-mute, even, and just listen to people. It'll be so nice not having to say anything back, to lose that expectation of needing to reply and _validate_ anything for the other person. Instead, just, as my contribution to the conversation, to just...understand people in peace. I..."

I regretted everything immediately, even as the last words were spilling out of my mouth. _Why the fuck did I say all that?_ I looked in panic for her reaction. She didn't say anything, her face blank. No, not just blank. Stone. 

"Then it was gone," I added quickly, before she did say something. "The thought, the impulse, whatever it was, vanished as quickly as it had come. It was so weird." I laughed feebly, my heart pounding.

She reached out, and put her hand on mine. "Do you still feel that way now? About wanting to disappear?" I looked from her hand up to her eyes and jolted; I had never seen her look so worried.

_Shit, bring it back bring it back._

"Oh no, I don't feel like that at all anymore," I said. "Like I said, it wasn't anything, just a random passing thought, you know." I fake-laughed again, this time going for a hearty chuckle.

She nodded after a moment, gave my hand a pat. "That's good," she said, flashing a quick smile that did nothing to ease the concern in her eyes. 

_That was so bad. I should not have said anything._ I needed a quick distraction.

"Hey, I got it," I said. "The first thing I'll do with my millions is to pay for your shrimp."

"Hey, now that's more like it!" she said eagerly. She pushed away her plate and signaled for the check. "Look at you, ballerin'. I can get used to this. You see, the money's going to your head already."

Loubelle came around and she did her best. She patted her stomach and explained how filling that was. "Mmm, just couldn't finish." She even burped.

"Oh, that's all right, darling. Let me get you a box. You can save it for breakfast!" She put down the bill and left before she could protest. 

As I signed the receipt, I thought I knew what was bothering her. I knew that she was right too. I would change. Not today, or tomorrow, maybe not even next year. But the money would jar me out of the normal everyday life of people who got up in the morning for the train and worried about health insurance and how they would pay for their kids' college. I might be imagining it, but just now, I felt strangely distant, slightly detached from the people around me--Loubelle, the family with the baby twins, the loud teenagers in the corner. Her too? I didn't know. I was a free floating cog, spinning. Like Tuck Everlasting. I was no longer part of the big wheel.

"I'm going to leave a $1,000 tip for Loubelle," I whispered.

Her eyes fully lit up. "Love it! Do it!" She looked around conspiratorially for Loubelle, almost giddy. "You have to write a note. 'You were right about the shrimp melt. Just gorgeous.'"

"Perfect." I signed with a flourish.  

I tried not to draw attention, but I nearly ran out as I got near the door. Being there to soak up Loubelle's gratitude would be the worst, most gauche thing possible. I didn't want her to wish she had been nicer to me earlier, because she had been right and I _had_ been mean, but now the money had corrupted the situation. And I would have to sit there and be modest and unfazed and make it seem like I was above petty human nature. I cringed just thinking about it.

"Did she pick up the check yet?" I asked, standing just outside. She looked over her shoulder as she closed the door. Despite myself, I looked back too. Loubelle was halfway to the kitchen with our plates, when she stopped abruptly, and stared down at the check. Just as she started to turn around, we ducked and ran around the corner.

"That was the best!" She was breathless. Her cheeks turned rosy from the sudden cold. She smiled the most beautiful smile. "Let's go, I know what you can buy me next."


*****


"Where are we going?" I followed her out into the chilly late autumn dusk. The light was growing weak.

"The ice cream cart!" she said. "It'll be a great human biopic bit. When they interview you, and ask what was the first thing you bought, you can say the special at Elbie's. And then you say you got ice cream after that. They'll lap it up."

We crossed the street into the park. It had lost most of its leaves and felt half empty, packed up, almost. We walked beside a stream that ran through the park. A few straggling geese bathed.

"I wish it were autumn all the time. Screw the other seasons. This is the best," I declared. "Just everything perpetually winding down, on the cusp of something cozy."

 "You can migrate," she said. "Just follow autumn slowly across the globe. I wonder what that route would look like if you graphed it."

We lost sight of the buildings now, and made our way deeper into the park, meandering with the stream. 

"Did you claim your ticket yet? How does the logistics work?" she said.

"The lottery office was closed already. I'll head down first thing tomorrow morning."

"Where's your ticket?" she asked, suddenly worried. 

I patted my front shirt pocket. "Right here."

She looked, then laughed. "You sewed it shut!"

"I made a couple of copies, signed all of them. The original is in a ziplock bag in here. I heard about someone doing this. He didn't take his shirt off until he got to the state lottery offices."

"Oh man, even with your impregnable high-security system in place, tonight is going to be the longest night of your life."

The path widened ahead of us. The ice cream cart was where it always was, next to the stone bridge. The old cart owner sat bundled up on a stool beneath a wide beach umbrella. She perked up when she saw us walk up. "What can I get you two?"

The ice cream sat in large pails inside the cart. There were four flavors: chocolate, strawberry, vanilla, and the last one. It was labeled "?"

"I'll take that one," she said, pointing to the fourth pail. The ice cream was pale yellow with rough specks in it.

"Me too," I said. _How could you not pick that?_

"It's a good one today," the cart owner said. She scooped out a single for each of us and sprinkled something shiny on top, like clear chips of ice. By the old dim park lamps, the ice cream sparkled.

"Lemon...mint?" She ventured a guess after an initial taste.

"Close," the cart owner said.

"Lemon basil?" I said.

"Bingo," she said, and gave me my free scoop.

As we walked away, she said, "Not fair, you're not allowed to get free things anymore." She didn't bother licking her ice cream; she bit off quick chunks and chewed vigorously.

"It would be unfair if I didn't," I said. "Merit should still apply, regardless of how much money someone has."

"No way," she said, shaking her head. "You're wrong. You shouldn't even be allowed to guess what the flavor is. This is for all the people who would appreciate getting free ice cream. It's genuine joy, the kind you get when the universe lets up on you a little bit. It's delight. When _you_ get the free scoop, even if you guessed correctly and _earned_ it and all that, it's not true delight. Because it's not evidence of a kind universe for you. It's evidence of a business universe, where merit lives, where you win because you have better taste buds than I do."

"But I _am_ delighted," I protested. "Look!" I licked my ice cream lasciviously. "And to me, a universe that gives you what you put in is the very definition of kindness."

She scowled. "That's a dismal definition of kindness." She bit through her waffle cone with a crunch. "Fairness should be default. Kindness is the good stuff on top of that."

"You're devaluing fairness, almost taking it for granted. _Fairness_ is the good stuff on top."

"What about charity then?" she said. "_That’s_ what kindness is--giving more than you get back." Then her face lit up. "But ha! You don't believe in charity! That's where this is leading. I'm right, aren't I?" She smirked triumphantly.

_I’m so obvious._ "I don't plan to give anyone any of the money," I admitted.

"Figures," she said.

"I do have a reason, I'll have you know," I said. "I'm not handing out bootstraps to people just yet. But it's kind of..."

"I'm listening," she said.

"Uh," I said. _Just go._ "Okay, so the lottery is inherently _fair_, right. Every ticket has an equal chance to win; it doesn't matter who you are."

"Right," she nodded.

"So, when someone wins the lottery, it's not an event that tips or disturbs the cosmic scale. Everything is square before the event, and everything is square after the event. No net change. There's my dollar and the astronomical odds of winning on one side, and a hundred million dollars on the other side. So when I won this money, even though it seems like the money fell out the back of the universe's truck and I just happened to be there and don't deserve it, I don't feel like I have incurred any obligation to readjust the universe by giving any money away."

"So, you don't believe in charity because you don't want to disturb the balance of the universe?"

_How did she make that sound so bad so easily?_

"Cause it won't be fair anymore, right?" she continued.

"Yeah," I said, meek. I licked my ice cream.

She blew out a breath. "Well, that just sounds exhausting, keeping track of the universe like that," she said. "Know what? You should just relax. The universe doesn't care about anyone. Especially you. The universe _especially_ doesn't care about you. Hey." 

She reached out and knocked my ice cream cone from my hands. It splattered on the ground and the top scoop, my _free_ scoop, detached and rolled around in the dirt.

_The fuck!_ "The fuck!" I said. I gaped at her. She burst out laughing and pointed at me.


*****


We crossed the stone bridge over the stream. The sun had finally set. Darkness turned the water into ink. A few people were still out in the cold, holding hands.

"I never have time to do this," I said. "Just walk around. Right now, I'd be rushing back from work, trying to catch the bus. And there really isn't any reason why I have to rush either. I don't have a cake in the oven or anything, you know? If I do manage to get back early, I'll just waste it watching TV or something."

"Yeah," she said. "It sounds like you were rushing to get away more than you were trying to go anywhere. High pressure to low pressure."

"Like a plugged pig from a chute," I said. 

"Exactly right!" she said. "Speaking of that, did you quit your job yet?"

"Well, no, not yet. I know, I know, before you say anything, I am going to, of course. I just haven't decided how. I was thinking I would call my boss tomorrow and just flatly tell her I quit. I'm not going to tell her why. Is that bad? Do you think I should at least go in and resign in person?"

"No, no, you shouldn't even wait until tomorrow. What are you waiting for? In fact, do it now! Call your boss and quit. Do it, do it, do it," she chanted.

I hesitated, trying to run the scenarios. _Yeah, what _am_ I waiting for?_ I took out my phone before I could reconsider. I felt a growing buzz of anticipation. I paused again, quickly playing back the recent events today, trying to make sure they all lined up logically from one to the next and prove I wasn't dreaming or crazy, that I had really won the lottery.

She looked at me like a salivating wolf.

I dialed. Suddenly light-headed, I started counting the rings. Just as I simultaneously hoped and feared that the call would go to voicemail, someone picked up. "Hello? Escophele?" _Here goes._

"Hi Lisa? Yes, it's me. Sorry to call you so late. I, uh..." I tried not to look at her lurking at the corner of my vision. "I quit." My heart pounded in my ears.

"Pardon?"

"I quit," I said again.

She didn't say anything for a few seconds. "Where are you? Are you okay?"

"I'm fine. I just wanted to tell you. I resign. I don't have a letter or anything; I wanted to tell you in person, well not in person in _person_, obviously, as we're on the phone, but you know, talk to you. I won't be coming in tomorrow and I, uh, I quit." I never wanted to hang up more in my life.

"Wait, wait, hold on. Can you come in tomorrow and talk more about it? This is rather sudden." 

She waved her arms, gesturing me to hang up.

"No, sorry, I can't do that. This is it. I quit," I said again. I didn't think I would have to say "I quit" this many times.

"Escophele, let's not be so hasty now. Why don't you just come by tomorrow after you've slept on it. And we can talk about it one on one."

She whispered frantically and made to grab the phone. I swiveled, covering the mouth piece. She yanked it out of my hand anyway.

"Viva la France, bitchman!" She yelled triumphantly into the phone. Then she hung up and handed it back to me.

_Did she just..._ I looked at her, who had fallen over and was literally rolling on the ground, clutching her sides with tears streaming down her cheeks. 

_Bitchman?_


*****


It was fully dark as we crossed the second bridge that took us back over to the city side of the park. The light from the street lamps broke and shimmered across the surface like bright shards of glass.  

We just walked in the dark, not saying anything. The feeling of detachment returned, stronger now. _What's going to happen now? In the end of all this, will I just float away to space?_ I turned the phone over and over inside my pocket. I had done it. No more job. _Well, she had done it._ I looked over at her.  

"Have you found a job yet?" I asked.

"No," she said, suddenly weary. "Still an unemployed deadbeat. Just like you now."

"Thanks."

"Anytime buddy." She patted my back. "And I know what you're thinking. It's been a while," she said, "And before you get any wacky theories, no, I haven't started whoring to pay rent; I recently moved in with Chris," she said.

_Same thing._ I thought, then immediately hated myself. "Oh really? Getting serious," I said.

"Yeah," she said. "Well, I don't know. I guess. He asked me a few weeks ago," she said. 

"So where is the place?"

"It's at that new complex by the lake."

"Wow, fancy. Those condos look really nice." 

"Yeah, seriously, they are. I didn't want to be a moocher, you know, but he insisted it was fine. So I'm like a house-girlfriend." She laughed, then abruptly cut off. She got quiet. "I cook these big breakfasts for him--" She shook her head like she didn't believe it and looked away.

I had no idea. I wanted to hug her and tell her it's okay.

Instead I said, "Unemployment gets an unfair and bad rep. It's a far more nobler state of being that the alternative. To be employed and used, eck. Like cows."

"Nah, it's okay, thanks for saying that though," she said, smiling briefly at me, and touched my elbow. I stared at her in awe. _She spoils me._

"It's not like that," she said. "I _want_ to work. It's just that I'm not a good worker. It's not even that I'm lazy. I'm just bad at it. I try and I mess up."

"You were doing fine. Why did you leave?"

"I got fired."

"Oh," I said, stupidly. "Sorry."

"Yeah, well, just talking about it now, it was gimmicky almost. Like, it was as if I only got it so I could bring it up in conversations and one-up everyone else. I'd rather be in the other category of jobs, like a nurse, or a teacher, where it's not flashy or anything, but important, you know? Jobs that are _professions_, obviously useful and beneficial to society."

"But not like peace corps or nonprofit people?" I said.

"When someone tells me they work for so and so charity organization, I instantly dismiss them in my head. Just shut up and do your save-the-world job and don't say a goddamn word. I lose interest immediately in the same way as if they told me they were a data analyst or whatever corporate thing--" She paused abruptly, splayed her hands, and gave a slight shrug. "I guess I'm cynical."

"Yeah you really are," I said. "It's quite some mental aerobatics to lump peace corps people with middle managers."

"The middle managers are better," she got fired up again. "Much better. They're at least honest about it. They know they're generic and doing it for the money and lack of ambition. I look at people's motivations pretty mercilessly. It thrills the fuck out of me to think about all those homeless advocates and nonprofit people, all proud and shit when they wake up every day, doing their thankless jobs and making the world a better place. I will save three kids from poverty today! It's fucking ego commission. I can't get enough of that satisfaction knowing how fucking proud they are."

"What about your nurses and teachers? They're probably patting their own backs every day."

"They deserve to. They actually save lives and have a direct connection with the world."

"And you give me so much beef about charity," I said. "You're just as bad as me! People aren't their jobs. A lot of times, they find whatever they could get, work at it, get promoted, and before you know it, they have that name tag under their portraits. 'Jane the Accountant.' 'Tess the Lumberjack.'"

"People can change; they can choose for themselves to stay or go," she said.

"It's not that easy," I said.

"It's easier than you think. You should have quit a long time ago," she said. "All it took was that phone call. You really didn't even need to win the lottery to do that!"

"It's a whole different story if you have a family with kids," I said. "No way can someone throw their paycheck away like that."

She didn't reply for a minute. "Yeah, you're right," she said. "Kids. You can't get out of that one. I suppose we're all stuck then."

I stopped short, deflated. I was counting on her to keep arguing, that there was some way. I didn't know what else to say. We walked and returned to silence.

The wind picked up, colder still. The stars dimmed as a layer of clouds slid in. A storm rumbled in the distance. 

"I would never have kids," she said.

"Why not?"

"Too scary. What if they come out with severe mental retardation problems and never develop empathy? They'll have the mind of a two-year-old for the rest of their lives and you spend the rest of yours changing their diapers and calming them down in public." 

"That's true unconditional love, I suppose," I said.

"I can never be that big or strong of a person to do that," she said. "If my kid comes out like that, I'm going to put it up for adoption for damn sure. Or abort, if I find out early enough. The super hard part would be if they don't catch anything in the screening and the kid is born and I can't put it up for adoption because who the hell wants to adopt a retarded baby?" She threw up her hands, tearing up. She wiped at her eyes furiously.

"Uh," I said, caught off guard.

She breathed audibly for a moment, then continued, "I would have no problem with physical disabilities. At least you're still dealing with a functional human being who will love you and you can talk to them, and they can get robot bodies later in life. I never tell people this, but I have a strict definition of a person. If they're not mentally capable of empathy, then I don't consider them human beings. I have no sympathy for criminals and violent murderers. Death penalty all the way, baby." She pumped a fist.

I said, "The justice system doesn't know the truth, can't know the truth, no one can. Killing someone based on that uncertainty is too final a thing for us to call. Like all those death row inmates, where new evidence comes up and they're actually innocent after all. I'll gladly let a hundred guilty go free than let them kill an innocent person."

"I'm on the other side of that fence, then," she said. "I can't stand the thought of letting the bad guys get away. I'm glad there are people like you to stick up for the good guys. Protect the innocent. Catch the kids."	

"They are important, you know. Kids," I said. "Even after you cut away the social and biological emphasis the entire history of life has put on offspring, children keep their sacred status, even now when we don't have to blindly follow our biological impulses. They solve boredom, the great enemy of modern life. Having kids is getting a life expansion; the last one after marriage. Nothing else after that."

She shook her head. "I can't abstract things out like that," she said. "Kids will be new and exciting, yes, a new level of experiences, a whole new world. But go past all that, and look: You have a human being there, in your hands. _Your_ human being. You can't fuck up now." She hugged herself against the chill. "And I fuck up." 

It was all I could do to not break down at the vulnerability destroying at her. I wanted to touch her. But no, instead--_of course, as always_--I just said, "It could be that you're not ready yet, you know?"

"Yeah?" she said. 

"Yeah. I think you will, eventually. No one's ready for kids when they first have them. You might not even realize it when you're ready, until you actually pop one out."

"Heh," she said.

"And you're allowed to mess up. Kids are resilient and doughy. Their limbs grow back."

She smiled now. "Ugh, I get so monolithic and rigid about this kind of stuff. Of course I can mess up, you're right. Things don't all just shatter. Most things are like kids, I would guess. Doughy, heh," she said.

"For sure. Kids are the doughiest things around. You can't mess up kids, not really, unless you try. And even then, they will just stop listening to you one day and go off and join a bike gang or something."

"Hmm," she murmured, hugging herself again as the first drops of rain fell. 

We hurried now. We left the stream behind, ducked through the dead trees, and almost made it out of the park when the storm broke in earnest. We were soaked in seconds. As we got under a bus stop, something caught her attention. She ran out into the rain again, and waved back at me. "Come on!" She pointed.

Across the slick black street, through the cold and rain, the Louis Hotel shone like a seaside beacon.


*****


The hotel lobby glowed from behind the enormous revolving doors. Golden light spilled out on the pavement. We dashed across the street with the storm at our backs.

We stepped into an instant warmth and civilized hush. Carefully, we shook ourselves off as much as we could near the door and approached the huge slab of granite that was the front counter. 

"We would like a room, please," she said, hair still dripping. I wiped my face and tried not to squelch.

The immaculately dressed and poised receptionist, the epitome of hospitality professionalism, didn't miss a beat. She smiled and said, "Certainly. We have a variety of choices available this evening. What would you like?"

"Do you have a suite?" she said.

The receptionist glanced down briefly, then flashed her smile again. "Yes we do. California king size bed with adjoining living area, office, and kitchen. Double vanities in the bathroom with rainhead shower. Outdoor jacuzzi in the balcony patio. $6,000 a night plus fees."

"We'll take it," I said.


*****


We stepped into the elevator with a glass back that overlooked downtown. Our suite was on a floor accessible only when we put in our room key in the slot in the elevator. _If only there were someone else in the elevator to show off our fancy elevator key to._

As the floor numbers lit up across the top, she said, "I wish there were someone else in here so we can like lean over and say, 'Pardon,' then insert our posh key card and press the exclusive floor button."

_I should have said that earlier!_ "Yeah," was all I said.

The view stretched out below us, expanding to all sides as we ascended. I pressed my palms against the glass. "I'm getting room service, all the room service, the entire menu, I don't even care. A whole roast chicken."

"Two chickens!" she said. "And a piglet!"

The door opened to a wide area of lush carpet that led off to other suites. There seemed only four of them on the entire floor. They each had an engraved metal plaque above each door. 

The Snowy Peaks. The Shoals. The Seven Winds-- 

She took off her wet shoes and socks and dug her toes into the shaggy sea of deep indigo carpet. She exhaled in satisfaction and dragged her feet to our set of doors. 

The Sunset.


*****


The room had double doors, with lacquered vertical handles. We oohed, flung them open, and stepped into everything I had imagined what opulence was, and then more. _How can people ever get used to this as normal?_

I was literally dazzled when I stepped in. Every surface glistened and flashed and threw back light. The high ceiling had three chandeliers. The floor was some kind of glossy polished rock, red as blood. Every piece of furniture looked freshly unwrapped. The chairs were those fancy, ultra modern, sharp designs that looked made all in one piece from a mold.

I headed straight for the kitchen and opened the huge fridge. I grabbed the first thing I saw--a thick slice of smoked salmon--and stuffed it in my face. "That's probably $50 right there," I said, licking my fingers and going for more.

She took a jar of chocolate truffles from the counter and filled her mouth. She followed that up with a canister of whipped cream, which just went everywhere.

Something took over us at that moment. The world had gone crazy. Ridiculous. We looked at each other and broke out in hysterical, side-splitting, gasping laughter. Nothing was real.

I jumped onto the blue leather couch with a glass of golden liquor and gestured like a senator in a forum, sloshing most of the drink as I intoned to the crowd. I had unbuttoned my shirt at that point. She turned up the sound system and held a bottle of wine in each hand, alternating swigs from each. The room service cart came by. We ripped into the platters of caviar and cheeses, steaks and lobsters, pastries and cakes. Everything tasted like a million dollars. She burped and splashed some wine on me. I threw a drumstick at her. I could hardly catch my breath from the delirium.

She drained a whole bottle of vodka over my head. I opened my mouth to catch the cascade, eyes closed from the cold burning alcohol. 

"Oopsies," she said. "Where are my manners? Please pass your cup, good sir." She reached across me for the glass I still held aloft in my other hand. 	

We were suddenly very close. I looked at her flushed face, cheeks and lips aflamed. I could hear my heart pounding. The air between us got warm. I gulped, eyes wide. I leaned in. Her face suddenly filled my entire vision, her eyes closed, lips slightly parted. My mind went blank.

Her tongue found mine. Slow and deliberate. She pressed tight against me, the length of her body slid and rose up. I wrapped my arms around her, and held on desperately. She made a low sound from her throat, which I felt more than heard.

We broke apart for breath. _This is the best thing ever._ Then, a spike of resolve. _Say it._

"I love--" 

"No." She shook her head sharply. "Stop." 

_Keep going!_ "But I do, I--"

"I don't want to hear it," She straightened and stood back, face hard. "Especially not from you."

Cold dread spread through my chest. Everything was turning.

"You don't love me," she said. "You don't even care about me."

"What? Of course I care--I mean, I love--" _Fuck._ I wavered, then slumped down off the couch, catatonic, and looked up at her with unfocused eyes.

I thought of all the times I didn't pick up her calls because I couldn't stand to talk to her and not say what I really wanted. "You're a hard person to reach," she would say. And all the times I did answer, and never said anything. "Thanks for always listening," she would say. There was this constant, silent pain. That meant something, right? I wouldn't hurt so much if I didn't love her, right? She couldn't be right.

"Where is all this coming from?" I said feebly. I didn't know why I asked it; it was the last thing I wanted to know. I could hear the hum of something awful drawing close, like a live wire.

She set her jaw. "I wanted to be happy for you, I really did," she said. "Winning the lottery, I mean, wow, you can't ask for a better thing. But not for you. It's going to be so bad. You don't have to do anything now. You can stay exactly the same. The money locks you in. You can indulge and drift and buy your way along. You will never have to let anyone in now, you understand? You don't have to confide, to depend, to try. Complete freedom, that's what you want, isn't it? You can be in your own crystal palace, and not need anyone--least of all, me."

"Crystal palace? What are you--"

"Shut up and listen. Someone has to tell you, and I'm telling you now. You're selfish and you're passive. You want everything for yourself, but you don't go after anything. There it is."

_No._ "I called you, and--and--bought you dinner, didn't I!"

"You called me because you had no one else," she said, shaking her head. "I'm tired of being the default. I really hoped you would take off and do something for a change. But I was stupid to hope. You won't change. I should have said something earlier but I was chickenshit."

_No._ "Then why did you stick around, huh? If I disappoint you so much? The diner? The park? All this?" I swept my arms grandly. I wasn't yelling. "If you hate being _loved_--and it is love--" I jabbed my chest. "Right here, that's where it comes from--not that you would recognize it--why _are_ you here then?" My face twisted. "Is it something to do with this?" I held up a hundred dollar bill to her, rubbing it between my fingertips and thumb. 

She jerked away as if slapped, shock dissolving into pain. She bit her lip, blinking hard. "You lonely fool."  

She turned and left.


*****


I lay on the ground, paralyzed. I didn't know what to do. I was mute, like always, mind swirling, uselessly, endlessly. Like always. Everything she said. I resisted, and resisted some more.

_Get up get up!_ Something inside me screamed. I was too late. I can't catch up. She's gone. _Run! Go after her! What are you doing what are you doing what are you doing--_

I leapt and ran out the door. I didn't know how long she had been gone while I lay there like a corpse. I stumbled to the elevator and smashed the button repeatedly. I swore, found the stairs, and ran down, half jumping, three at a time. I slammed against each landing and fell more than anything down to the ground floor.

I burst out of the hotel. She was nowhere in sight. I ran down the street, screaming for a taxi. I pushed my way to the front of a taxi line and shoved a handful of bills at the driver. "Condos by the lake. Go! Go now! I'll give you more if you can get me there in ten minutes." 

I collapsed and gasped for air in the backseat, chest heaving, shaking all over. My shirt hung unbuttoned and I had no shoes. 

_I was going to lose her forever._

I willed the car to move faster.


*****


The cab screeched to a halt in front of the main gates of the condo complex. I threw some more bills at the driver and ran inside to look for her car. I saw it and, heart swelling, saw the light by the door next to it. The shades were up. I ran up the steps. I reached the door--

Through the window into the living room, I saw her. She was kneeling. Her hair was down, and covered her bare shoulders and back. A crude hand grasped the back of her head, driving her head up and down.

I cried out with no sound. A blaze of pain so intense, I bent over and clutched my stomach. I couldn't look away.

The man gripped her head with both hands now; her hair flew around her. She clutched the rug she knelt on, knuckles white. The man threw his head back, muscles taut, straining. She tried to raise her head, but he held her down. Faster and faster, then his back arched. Her hands pressed against him, trying to push away, flailing.

I kicked the lock and slammed my way through the door. The man jolted in surprise and released her. She turned around in shock. Roaring, hysterical, crying, I fell on the man and hit his face as hard as I could. My hand crunched. I pinned him down with my knees, reared back and punched again. "What the fuck--" he managed before I hit him a third time.

Hands grabbed me from behind and threw me off. I slammed against the wall, hard. I looked up to see her, angrier than I had ever seen anybody. She punched me full in the face. I felt my nose break and blacked out momentarily. I staggered against the wall to keep my feet, one hand over my nose to hold back the blood. I stared at her in confusion, not even feeling the pain.

"What the fuck is wrong with you!" She screamed at me. "Get the fuck out!" 

I blinked, not comprehending. 

She stood protectively over the man on the couch, who was holding his face, groaning. She pointed out the door, eyes blazing. "I said, get out! I'm calling the cops." 

I backed up and held myself up against the door frame. "He was hurting you," I mumbled and looked at her for something, anything, from before.

There was nothing. Worse, there had never been anything.

Horrified, I fled.


*****


The lights of the street blurred around me. 	

Headlights slid in and out of my vision, washing me in complete blindness before sweeping darkness back in. I drifted in a flashing haze. I picked up my foot, then the other one. I didn't know where I was or where I was going.

People and faces started mixing in. I saw red lights, and must have gone inside. I was sweating and the bass matched the pounding in my head.

I took out cash and flung it everywhere. "I'm a fucking millionaire!" I shouted, but couldn't hear myself over the roar and noise. Sharp alcohol and heavy perfume all around. Breasts and thick lips pressed against my face, and I flung money and yelled some more. I drank and vomited and drank. Someone ripped off my shirt.

Sudden rough hands, and dull thuds of pain as fists punched my stomach and face. I laughed and collapsed. Kicks. I felt myself thrown out onto wet pavement. Then blackness.


*****


It hurt to move. It hurt to breathe. Everything hurt. Blood dripped and seeped through my swollen eyelid. At least it was quiet again, and cool.

I groaned, curling up with my forehead on the ground, knees bent. I fumbled for my phone. 

"Beth," I gasped, fading fast.

I lay in the alley, broken, empty, waiting for her answer.
